# Space Dust


This is a KSP mod designed to overhaul the atmospheric and exospheric mining experience in KSP. It functions both as a framework, providing part modules and distributions to others, and an actual gameplay mod designed to provide a set of parts focused around atmospheric ISRU in the stock system.

## Features


### Framework

This mod is for others too! See the [wiki](https://github.com/ChrisAdderley/SpaceDust/wiki) for how to configure distributions and modules. 

## Dependencies

### Required
These components are required for the mod to function and are bundled as part of any download:
* [ModuleManager (4.2.3)](https://github.com/sarbian/ModuleManager)
* [B9PartSwitch (2.18.0)](https://github.com/blowfishpro/B9PartSwitch)

## Installation

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, please do so.

NOTE: Do NOT rename or move folders within the GameData folder - this mod uses absolute paths to assets and will break if this happens.

## External Mod Compatibility

This mod includes compatibility patches for the following mods:
* [KSP-AVC](https://github.com/CYBUTEK/KSPAddonVersionChecker): Provides version checking

## Contributing

I certainly accept pull requests. Please target all such things to the `dev` branch though!
