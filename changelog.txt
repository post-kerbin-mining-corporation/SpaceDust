v0.2.0
------
- Fixed harvesting that broke last update
- Added SystemHeat integration: when SystemHeat is installed, ModuleSpaceDustHarvester can add heat to the system, and will overheat
- Improved ModuleSpaceDustTelescope
 - Occlusion is now a thing: can't observe planets through planets
 - Atmoshperic effects are now enabled: discovery rates are modulated by atmosphere (if your observatory is on a planet)

v0.1.5
------
- Tuned Antimatter distributions slightly
- Adjusted initialization of instruments

v0.1.4
------
- Fixed harvesters harvesting in t/m3, when they should have been using u/m3
- Fixed the UI showing t/m3 sometimes, should always be u/m3
- Distributions
 - Adjusted all exospheric resource distributions, were far too high
- Fixed large atmosphere processor's loop and activate animations
- Decreased static intake speed for processors to more realistic values
- Tuned efficiencies for processors

v0.1.3
------
- Fixed incorrect rotation of Sift-O-Tron 250

v0.1.2
------
- Fixed some major log spam

v0.1.1
------
- Added missing B9PartSwitch to distribution
- Added Science integration: in Science or Career mode, identifying or discovering a resource band will add science to your space program
  - This is configured by a base value in SpaceDustSettings.cfg, which is scaled by the Hight Orbit scale of the body in question
  - Configurable per-band by specifying discoveryScienceReward or identifyScienceReward in the band's configuration
- Fixed an issue where a part with ModuleSpaceDustTelescope would brick the game in a new and fun way

v0.1.0
------
- The beginning
