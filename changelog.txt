v0.5.1
------
- VABOrganizer support

v0.5.0
------
- Updated bundled MM to latest version
- UI now generally displays in t/m3 and t/s. This is to facilitiate comparisons between resources
- Improved the Resource Overlay
-- When a Resource is toggled on, mousing over a distribution in the map view will show a tooltip that describes the resource
-- Resources that are identified will show a max concentration, unidentified will show unknown
- Improved the Toolbar panel
-- Discovered bands are now always shown even if the overlay for that Resource is not enabled
-- Icon for bands that show if they're Exoatmospheric or Atmospheric
-- General improvements to scaling, pinning and lists
-- Behaves better with UI scaling
- Fixed a null reference that broke the UI when focused on something that wasn't a CB or a vessel (e.g a maneuver node)

v0.4.4
------
- Fixed a bug on loading when patching a space dust scanner (thanks Angel-125)

v0.4.3
------
- Fixed smaller Sift-O-Tron not being able to harvest atmospheric LF
- Added action groups to harvester, scanner, telescope modules
- Made it possible to deploy harvester, scanner, telescope modules in the VAB

v0.4.2
------
- KSP 1.12
- Fixed scanners, harvesters and telescopes still being allowed to work when power was lower than required, now resources will not be mined
- Added a screen message that posts when a converter overheats (with SystemHeat installed)
- Fixed orbit velocity being calculated incorrectly for exospheric harvesters in the background
- Fixed density of resources not being accounted for correctly for all harvesters in the background, leading to wildly low (or high) collection rates for resources outside of the 'normal' bounds

v0.4.1
------
- Updated to use SystemHeat 0.4+ API

v0.4.0
------
- Updated B9PartSwitch to 2.18.0
- Resources are visible in the tracking station
- Fixed an issue where null execptions would happen on switching to and from a Kerbal
- Rebalanced Jool resource distributions that were way too high.

v0.3.3
------
- Fixed tech node of gas scanner
- Better exception handling and logging for broken distributions and instruments
- Better default values for un/misconfigured distributions and instruments
- Fixed an issue that would cause scanned/harvested resources to not understand resource density correctly. 

v0.3.2
------
- Adjusted ArgonGas distribution 
- Disabled cargo partmodule in KSP < 1.11

v0.3.1
------
- Fixed SpaceDust panel not hiding when exiting map view
- A few informative debug messages for logging
- A couple of minor bugfixes

v0.3.0
------
- Marked for KSP 1.11.x
- Fixed pre-discovered resource distributions granting science at game start
- Gas Analyzer and Spectrometer are now storeable/placeable parts for 1.11 inventories

v0.2.3
------
- Corrected exospheric harvester localization
- Corrected exospheric harvester flipped equality causing doom
- Tweaked exospheric Antimatter distributions

v0.2.2
------
- Added a Settings flag for rescalers to use: GameScale (1.0 = stock scale)

v0.2.1
------
- Added Chinese translation
- Cleaned up some fields showing in flight when they shouldnt
- Reduced atmosphere edge threshold from 0.0001 atm to 1E-16 atm.
- Made some fixes related to parsing parts with underscores in their names
- Aligned SystemHeat related PartInfo blocks with SystemHeat PartInfo styles
- Added flag to check occlusion of ModuleSpaceDustHarvester intakes before allowing harvesting (on by default)
- Fixed some distributions that should have been using useAirDensity not using it

v0.2.0
------
- Fixed harvesting that broke last update
- Added SystemHeat integration: when SystemHeat is installed, ModuleSpaceDustHarvester can add heat to the system, and will overheat
- Improved ModuleSpaceDustTelescope
 - Occlusion is now a thing: can't observe planets through planets
 - Atmoshperic effects are now enabled: discovery rates are modulated by atmosphere (if your observatory is on a planet)

v0.1.5
------
- Tuned Antimatter distributions slightly
- Adjusted initialization of instruments

v0.1.4
------
- Fixed harvesters harvesting in t/m3, when they should have been using u/m3
- Fixed the UI showing t/m3 sometimes, should always be u/m3
- Distributions
 - Adjusted all exospheric resource distributions, were far too high
- Fixed large atmosphere processor's loop and activate animations
- Decreased static intake speed for processors to more realistic values
- Tuned efficiencies for processors

v0.1.3
------
- Fixed incorrect rotation of Sift-O-Tron 250

v0.1.2
------
- Fixed some major log spam

v0.1.1
------
- Added missing B9PartSwitch to distribution
- Added Science integration: in Science or Career mode, identifying or discovering a resource band will add science to your space program
  - This is configured by a base value in SpaceDustSettings.cfg, which is scaled by the Hight Orbit scale of the body in question
  - Configurable per-band by specifying discoveryScienceReward or identifyScienceReward in the band's configuration
- Fixed an issue where a part with ModuleSpaceDustTelescope would brick the game in a new and fun way

v0.1.0
------
- The beginning
